## Introduction
Upon discovering a substantial number of cancelled orders and their significant financial impact of 2 billion rupees, we recognized the pressing need to delve deeper into the factors influencing these cancellations. Our focus shifted towards investigating various variables' impact, aiming to uncover insights that would guide strategic measures to reduce cancellations, improve customer experiences, and safeguard financial interests.

## Final Insights
- Mobile and Tablets have the most cancelled orders, with menâ€™s fashion and others following the list.
- People are more likely to cancel orders if they are paying online. This could imply that customers are not very comfortable with using online modes of payment or there are technical issues with the e-commerce website.
- Top cancelled orders were for Infinix Phones, indicating people were not satisfied with the product. For example, the Infinix_Zero 4-Grey model showcases a substantial disparity between cancelled and completed orders, indicating that the overall high cancellation rate cannot be attributed solely to a large volume of orders in general.

## Recommendations
- Strategies such as product improvements, targeted marketing campaigns, or customer engagement initiatives can be implemented to reduce cancellations for these products.
- Improving the online payment experience, addressing security concerns, and offering incentives for online purchases could help mitigate cancellation rates for online payments.
